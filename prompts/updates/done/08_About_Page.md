- [DONE] The "Our Mission" section. Background image for "Our Mission" section is
  public/images/Our_MissionBG.png. The height of the section is 100% of the
  screen, and the height of the image is 100% of the section. The image is
  centered horizontally, and the image is very wide, so the left and right sides
  are off the screen; this is intentional. 

- [DONE] REview https://www.jointheleague.org/about/ for how  the "Coding Jobs"
  and "Entry INto workforce" sections appear. In the demo site, they are cards,
  but each of them should have it's own section. 

- [DONE] Copy the lottie animations for  "Coding Jobs" and "Entry INto workforce" from
  https://www.jointheleague.org/about/ Note that the icon is on the left for one
  section and to the right on the other. THe urls are:
   * Coding Jobs: https://www.jointheleague.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/graph.json
   *  Entry into Workforce: https://www.jointheleague.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/entry.json

   If there is a fulldev-ui component for lottie animations, use it.
