# Home Page

- [DONE] Legacy page dedicates individual cards to Python, Java, Tech Club, and Code Clinic with direct in-person/online enrollment links; the demo collapses those into a single “Weekly Programming Classes” narrative without plan-specific buttons.
- [DONE] Legacy “Other Programs” grid (League Labs, Project Clinic, Programming Merit Badge) is missing; the demo home lacks links or visuals for those offerings beyond the testimonials gallery.
- [DONE] Tuition Assistance panel (copy, Typeform link, policy note) is absent; financial aid now only appears indirectly via footer Explore → Policies.
- [DONE] “Preparing Youth for Careers” logos remain but move higher in the layout; the legacy copy emphasizes internship outcomes, while the demo variant shortens supporting text.
- [DONE] Legacy footer retains newsletter signup, nonprofit badges, and Scout photography; the demo footer drops signup fields and badges in favor of condensed contact and policy links.

- the logo on the original page in the upper left just to the left of about is substantially larger than on the new page

- In a dev page to the right of a log all way up to 2003 California nonprofit of the year image which it does not exist on the new page

- In a dev page, but donate and volunteer buttons have much wider radius than they donate and volunteer page on the original site. Those the original site look a lot more square.

- In the dev page. There is the league of amazing programmers logo at the top of the hero section, https://www.jointheleague.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/League-Logo-F-Horiz-Orange-FINAL-1-1200x325.png, but on the new page, we have the words, igniting young minds. Those those words would be replaced with the logo.

- in the development page igniting young minds phrase through the phrase igniting minds through coding is large, larger font, and black whereas in the original page, it's a small slightly smaller font and orange. Also the phrase at the league of amazing programmers. We prepare kids for the science of technology the cruisers of the 21st-century is bolded in the original page, but not my new page. We've got view our programs and join now in the death page which are not in the original page.

- under weekly programming classes the images on the Deb page are really small those the snake and coffee cup under the beginner and beginner advanced sections. They should take up 100% of the card that they're in and instead, they're you know they're really small.

- in the development page being enrolled in person, enroll online buttons their links and they should be buttons in the original page their buttons, and then they're on the same line and then learn more is right below them
