# Page Subhero menu

- Create a new SubMenu component. It will work a bit like a section, but instead
  will present a menu internal to a page. It will iterate through all of the
  sections, looking for a diata field that specified a navigation title and the
  `id`, and will show a horizonal menu. It is derived from section so it can
  have fade args. 

- Add it to the home page, immediately after the hero and set the fade colors to
  match the colors above and below. 

- add submenu nav data to these sections: "Free Classes", "More Ways to Learn" ( call it "Other Programs" ),
