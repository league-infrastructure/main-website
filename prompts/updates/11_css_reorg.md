# CSS Reorganization

There is still alot of CSS that seems to be in the wrong places, in site.css and
global.css. 

1) Analyze `site.css` and `global.css` anbd identify selector prefixes ( like
   `card__`) that belong to Component. Then, update this item to list the
   selectors ( the whole selector ) along with the component it should be
   assoßciated with.
