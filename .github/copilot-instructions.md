Add python modules with uv add. 

Use `uv run` to run programs. 

Do not create test programs in Here Docs on the terminal. Create
a separate .py file instead.

This project uses Astro. For mor information on astro, get an LLM 
overview at https://docs.astro.build/llms-full.txt

We are using fulldev-ui components, https://ui.full.dev/docs/. Prefer
to use the components as they are, but if you can create extensions 
of them, or custom components if required. However, custom components 
should start by copying or extending existing fulldev-ui components.
