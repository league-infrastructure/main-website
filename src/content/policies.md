# Privacy Policy

Understand how The League collects, stores, and uses personal information across our programs.

The privacy policy outlines what data we gather from students and guardians, why it is required for instruction, and how we safeguard it across our systems.

<content>
The League of Amazing Programmers limits the personal data we collect to information that supports instruction, safety, and account management. Parent or guardian contact details, student names, and limited demographic information are stored in secure systems that comply with federal and state privacy regulations. Access to this data is restricted to authorized staff and mentors who need it to support students.

Families can review our detailed commitment to student privacy, including how we manage third-party tools, by reading the full policy on our site.

Creating a welcoming learning environment means actively preventing discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. The League provides equal access to programs regardless of race, color, national origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, religion, or any protected class. Students, mentors, and families are expected to uphold these standards in all classes and events.

The full policy explains how concerns can be reported, how incidents are reviewed, and the corrective steps taken to protect participants.

# Membership Plans and Passes

Compare monthly tuition, memberships, and class passes to find the right fit for your student.

This guide details pricing for recurring classes, how rollovers work, and which plans unlock Tech Club sessions or drop-in visits.

<content>
Tuition plans cover one weekly class and bill on the first of the month. The monthly total stays the same regardless of holidays or absences, so families do not need to track schedule changes. Membership plans provide six visits per month and allow up to two unused visits to roll into the next billing cycle.

Popular options include:

- **Monthly Membership** - $280 for up to five visits each month across Python and Java classes.
- **Tech Club Membership** - Free access to Tech Club sessions and workshops.
- **Monthly Tuition** - $280 for one weekly class; legacy plan for existing families.
- **Class Pass** - $70 per single visit scheduled as needed.
- **Beta Test Pass** - Complimentary single visit to try a class.

Manage plans and passes through the [Pike13 portal](https://jtl.pike13.com/people/me/shop) after signing in.

# Make-up Policies

Use make-up passes to reschedule missed classes that match your student's level.

Understand how to cancel a session and apply the make-up pass to another class.

<content>
When you cancel a weekly class in advance, the system issues a make-up pass to your account. Use the pass to enroll in another class of the same topic and level within the same week or at a later date. All make-ups are self-scheduled through the portal just like regular classes.

Visit your [League profile](https://jtl.pike13.com/me) to see available passes, check expiration dates, and secure the next session.

# Refunds and Late Fees

Review refund limitations and why timely tuition payments matter.

This policy explains when credits are issued, how late fees work, and why on-time payments keep classes running smoothly.

<content>
Tuition is non-refundable and non-transferable. Credits or adjustments are not offered for absences, closures, or unused visits. Accounts that pay after the first of the month incur an automatic $25 late fee.

Families are responsible for maintaining an active payment method and submitting payments on time to avoid disruptions.

# Enrolling in Classes

Learn how to enroll, secure recurring spots, and manage schedules in the Parent Portal.

This overview is ideal for new families setting up profiles, purchasing plans, and choosing weekly classes.

<content>
Create a Parent Portal profile for each student, purchase the appropriate plan or pass, and register directly from the class schedule. After your first session, let the instructor know if you would like to reserve the same day and time each week, or email [info@jointheleague.org](mailto:info@jointheleague.org?subject=Bulk%20Enrollment&body=Hi%2C%20I%20would%20like%20to%20bulk%20enroll%20in%20weekly%20classes.).

Additional tips:

- Browse the [Classes page](https://jtl.pike13.com/categories/93504) to find the best day, time, and format.
- Cancel a class from the **Upcoming** section of the portal to avoid losing a visit.
- Make-up passes issued after cancellations can be applied to future sessions through the same schedule view.
