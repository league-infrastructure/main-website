# Membership Plans and Passes

Review how tuition billing and membership visits work across our weekly
programs.

Learn how monthly tuition billing works, what membership plans include, and how
to manage visits and plan holds.

<content>


## TUITION

<a href="https://jtl.pike13.com/membership_products/615316">Tuition plans</a>
offer one class per week. Tuition is due on the 1st of each month. Monthly
tuition remains the same whether it is a long (5-week) or short (3-week) month
and regardless of absences, vacations, or holidays. There are no make-up classes
for holidays, as they are built into the cost of tuition.

## MEMBERSHIP

<a href="https://jtl.pike13.com/membership_products/590552">Membership plans</a>
offer 6 visits per month, and up to 2 unused visits in one month will roll over
to the next month. You are responsible for enrolling and cancelling your
students; no-shows will be charged a visit. If you expect to miss a class,
cancel your attendance in the class and enroll in another one. You can enroll in
any class that is allowed for the Membership plan, even in multiple classes per
week.  There are no refunds issued for missed classes that do not roll over; you
are responsible for putting a hold on your membership if you expect to miss many
classes. </content>

# Makeup Classes

See how makeup passes let students rebook missed sessions and stay on track.

Explains how make-up passes work and how to reschedule sessions to keep a
consistent learning rhythm.

<content> While makeups are not mandatory, they are highly encouraged. At The
League, we strongly encourage all students to attend their classes consistently,
in order to develop their programming skills.

After you cancel a class, you will be issued a <strong>Make-up Pass, </strong>
which you can use on another visit. Return to the scheduling page for the class
you want to enroll in, and enroll in the class. For "Which pass or plan do you
want to use for this?" select the pass you wish to use.

We no longer offer Make Up classes as separate labs. Instead, you can simply
enroll your student in another class, during the same week, or a different week.
You can schedule makeup classes in the same way as any other class. Just enroll
your student in a class that offers the same topic and similar level as the
class your student normally attends.

schedule your classes. </content>
