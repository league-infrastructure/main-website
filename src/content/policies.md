## TUITION

<a href="https://jtl.pike13.com/membership_products/615316">Tuition plans</a> offer one class per week. Tuition is due on the 1st of each month. Monthly tuition remains the same whether it is a long (5-week) or short (3-week) month and regardless of absences, vacations, or holidays. There are no make-up classes for holidays, as they are built into the cost of tuition.

## MEMBERSHIP

<a href="https://jtl.pike13.com/membership_products/590552">Membership plans</a> offer 6 visits per month, and up to 2 unused visits in one month will roll over to the next month. You are responsible for enrolling and cancelling your students; no-shows will be charged a visit. If you expect to miss a class, cancel your attendance in the class and enroll in another one. You can enroll in any class that is allowed for the Membership plan, even in multiple classes per week.  There are no refunds issued for missed classes that do not roll over; you are responsible for putting a hold on your membership if you expect to miss many classes.

# Makeup Classes

<blurb_placeholder>

<description_placeholder>

<content>
While makeups are not mandatory, they are highly encouraged. At The League, we strongly encourage all students to attend their classes consistently, in order to develop their programming skills.

After you cancel a class, you will be issued a <strong>Make-up Pass, </strong> which you can use on another visit. Return to the scheduling page for the class you want to enroll in, and enroll in the class. For "Which pass or plan do you want to use for this?" select the pass you wish to use.

We no longer offer Make Up classes as separate labs. Instead, you can simply enroll your student in another class, during the same week, or a different week. You can schedule makeup classes in the same way as any other class. Just enroll your student in a class that offers the same topic and similar level as the class your student normally attends.

Visit your <a href="https://jtl.pike13.com/me">LEAGUE profile </a>to find and schedule your classes.
