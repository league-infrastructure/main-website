# Python

Python is the best language to start with. It’s the most popular programming
language, and useful for every kind of programming.

The Python language is one of the most accessible programming languages
available because it has simplified syntax. Due to its ease of learning and
usage, python codes can be easily written and executed much faster than other
programming languages. Python is the most important language for data analysis
and AI and is important in robotics, scientific computing, web sites, and many
other fields.

# Java

Python is the best language to start with. It’s the most popular programming
language, and useful for every kind of programming.

Java is a  popular language for many fields,  which means there’s a huge variety
of job choices for engineers who specialize in it. Java is the driving force
behind many cutting edge technologies, such as working in the cloud, exploring
space at NASA, running self driving cars, and making games. Java is the language
used in AP Computer Science, and is the dominant language for corporate
computing, particularly in the finance industry.

# Technology

We have many other technology classes involving AI, games, and robotics.

Our technology classes offer a wider variety of tech experiences in one program,
with shorter courses covering more topics. Students can build games, program
microcontrollers, race robots, or choose projects of their own.
