<p>“<a href="https://www.eryary.sautebrandpartners.com/">The League of Amazing Programmers</a> is a nonprofit after school program that teaches kids the skill of computer programming.</p>
<p>Students from grades 5 to 12 go to the Carmel Valley-based campus and work with professional programmers on everything from creating games to making mobile phone apps.</p>
<p>June Clarke, 36, is the lead teacher at The League. The former software engineer left her private consulting company to take on the role of an educator.</p>
<p>The North Park resident, who moved to San Diego from her native Ireland in 2001, explains why she’s so passionate about her new career path.”</p>
