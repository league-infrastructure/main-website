<p>“More than 75 students from across California will participate in the eighth annual Autonomous Robotics Competition (iAROC) at the Reuben H. Fleet Science Center in Balboa Park.</p>
<p>Student-programmed, Roomba-style robots will compete in races, challenges, and mazes on Saturday, June 27, and Sunday, June 28.</p>
<p>Anyone with a Fleet ticket can watch this two-day competition from inside the museum.</p>
<p>“This is a friendly competition,” says Vic Wintriss, founder of The League of Amazing Programmers, which hosts the event. “The kids form teams and get to know each other … they support each other and cheer each other on.”</p>
<p>The contestants are an enthusiastic bunch. They attend RoboCamp, a free weeklong camp where they make final adjustments to their robots and prepare for competition weekend.”</p>
