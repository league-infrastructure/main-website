<p>The traumatic events of recent weeks have challenged us all, often in unexpected ways. As an organization, we acknowledge that racism exists in today’s society and that we have students, families, and staff among us who are hurting. We know that hoping for change is not enough. Together, we have the responsibility to create a better future. We stand against racism and social injustice, and we are committed to fostering diversity, equity and inclusion in the work that we do.</p>
<p>League teachers and staff work hard to prepare our students with the skills and education to become future leaders in a global digitized world. We seek specifically to reach more girls and underserved youth so that children from all backgrounds can contribute to the workforce of the 21st century.</p>
<p>As we reflect on what has occurred, let us all look within our hearts for ways that we can confront racism and social injustice, address inequality, and build a brighter future. Black lives matter. We are committed to creating opportunities and space for black people to thrive in our organization.</p>
<p>Together, as parents, teachers &amp; employees, we can all be an example to our students of how to make changes to our society. We will continue to partner with other community organizations and parents to develop new ideas and implement new strategies for a better future for all.</p>
