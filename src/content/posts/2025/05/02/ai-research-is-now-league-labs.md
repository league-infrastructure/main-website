<p>We’ve been recruiting students for a summer AI Research program, and the initial response has been excellent. However, the <a href="https://www.jointheleague.org/coding-programs/league-labs/">League Labs</a> program has many more students, and a lot of the students interested in AI were also interested in League Labs, so we are going to combine them.  What this means is that students involved in the AI project will have as part of their project a requirement to present their research as a tutorial at the end of the summer.</p>
<p>We’re going to add the AI students to the same lists at the other League Labs students, so you will see the announcements about this over the next few weeks.</p>
