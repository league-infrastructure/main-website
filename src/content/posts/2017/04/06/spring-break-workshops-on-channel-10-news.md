<p>Local reporter Jared Aarons visited the League at the Malcolm X Library during the March 2017 workshop week.  Concurrently, camps were also held at the Central Library branch and Gompers Prep.  Almost 40 scholarship students were given the opportunity to take the workshop which was funded by grants and donations.  Almost 1/2 of the attendees were girls!  <a href="http://www.10news.com/news/kids-learn-computer-coding-during-spring-break-camp">Watch this great story!</a></p>
