<p>Long-time student Delara Aryan has been awarded the prestigious Stamps Scholarship.  Before heading to the University of Southern California in the fall, she is spending her summer as a student intern teacher at The LEAGUE!  We at the The LEAGUE are extremely proud of Delara, and wish her and all of our other students that are heading to college in the fall the best of luck.</p>
