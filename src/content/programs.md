##  Programming Classes

blurb: Comprehensive Java and Python programming from beginner to advanced levels,
preparing students for AP Computer Science and professional careers.

description: Our Java program offers a complete pathway from introduction through advanced
programming, with curriculum aligned to AP Computer Science standards. Java is
the dominant language in corporate computing, particularly in finance, and
powers cutting-edge technologies including cloud computing, NASA space
exploration, and self-driving cars. Students learn fundamental programming
concepts, object-oriented design, data structures, and algorithms through
hands-on projects. Our experienced instructors guide students toward
professional Java certification, which opens doors to job opportunities at
companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Sony. Classes meet weekly for 1.5
hours with a 5:1 student-to-teacher ratio, available both in-person and online.

## Robotics, AI and Technology Classes

blurb: Learn and have fun with robotics and electronics in Robot Riot and Tech
Arcade classes. 

description: The Robotics, AI and Technology program gives students a hands-on tour of modern intelligent systems, blending mechanical design, physical computing, and software thinking. Through Robot Riot and Tech Arcade labs learners prototype and program robots, wire sensors and actuators, and iterate on real-world engineering challenges in an energetic studio environment. AI Agents workshops introduce fundamental artificial intelligence concepts like perception, decision making, and responsible automation using approachable tools and experiments. The program emphasizes creativity, teamwork, and problem-solving while showing how robotics, machine learning, and emerging technologies intersect across industries—from manufacturing and healthcare to art and entertainment.

## Tech Club 

blurb: Free introductory classes in Python, Java, robotics, and electronics offered at
schools and libraries.

description: Tech Club brings coding education to students who might not otherwise have
access, offering free introductory courses at schools and libraries throughout
San Diego County. These 60-90 minute sessions introduce students in grades 3-12
to programming through hands-on projects in Python, Java, robotics, and
electronics. With a less than 10:1 student-to-teacher ratio and no cost to
families, Tech Club removes barriers to computer science education. Many
students who start in Tech Club later transition to our paid weekly classes as
they advance, but Tech Club provides valuable programming experience regardless
of whether students continue. Classes run year-round at various locations.

## Robot Garage

blurb: Advanced robotics course building on Robot Riot fundamentals.

description: In the Robot Garage students of any level can pursue projects in electronics,
robotics and programming.  Students learn the detailed functioning of motor
signals and power systems, basic electrical circuits, how servos and stepper
motors work at a technical level, 3D printing for custom robot parts, and
soldering electronics. Special projects might include the beginnings of robotic
navigation, working with sensors like sonar, infrared distance sensors, and
April tags for robot awareness and positioning. Projects become more ambitious
and student-directed, allowing learners to pursue their specific interests
whether that's competition robotics, practical automation, or creative robotic
art. The course prepares students for participation in robotics competitions and
provides skills directly applicable to careers in robotics engineering,
automation, and mechatronics.

## Code Clinic

blurb: Free online classes teaching professional programming technologies and advanced
techniques.

description: Code Clinic offers free online instruction in professional-level programming
tools and techniques for more advanced students. These classes cover topics like
version control systems, professional development environments, software
testing, debugging strategies, and industry-standard practices that professional
programmers use daily. Code Clinic helps bridge the gap between learning syntax
and working like a professional developer, preparing students for internships,
jobs, and university-level computer science. These classes are offered free as
free as part of our mission to prepare youth for technology careers.

## League Lab 

blurb: Advanced program where students work as apprentices on research projects and
learn sophisticated programming.

description: League Lab provides an advanced learning environment for students who have
progressed beyond our standard curriculum and are ready for professional-level
work. Students in League Lab function as apprentices, working on substantial
research projects, contributing to open-source software, or developing their own
ambitious applications. With guidance from professional developers and computer
scientists, students learn advanced topics like machine learning, systems
programming, algorithm design, or specialized domains they're passionate about.
League Lab students often present their work at conferences, publish papers, or
launch real products. This program develops the independent learning and
problem-solving skills essential for success in computer science careers and
research.
