## Python Programming

Python is the most popular programming language, perfect for beginners
and powerful enough for professionals.

Students learn Python through hands-on projects that build
fundamental programming skills while keeping learning fun and engaging. Our
Python pathway helps students master variables, loops, functions, and
object-oriented programming, preparing them for AP Computer Science Principles
and real-world problem solving. Small cohorts and experienced instructors ensure
every student gets the support they need, whether meeting online or in person.
