With guidance from professional developers and computer\nscientists, students learn advanced topics like machine learning, systems\nprogramming, algorithm design, or specialized domains they're passionate about.\nLeague Lab students often present their work at conferences, publish papers, or\nlaunch real products. This program develops the independent learning and\nproblem-solving skills essential for success in computer science careers and\nresearch.\n\n- Apprenticeship-style mentorship with experienced engineers and researchers\n- Opportunities to contribute to open-source and real-world software projects\n- Exposure to advanced topics tailored to each student's interests and goals\n\nTo prepare for projects, students can take free short classes in our Code CLinic\nmeetup.  Classes cover topics like version control systems, professional\ndevelopment environments, software testing, debugging strategies, and\nindustry-standard practices that professional programmers use daily. Code Clinic\nhelps bridge the gap between learning syntax and working like a professional\ndeveloper, preparing students for internships, jobs, and university-level\ncomputer science. These classes are offered free as part of our mission to\nprepare youth for technology careers.\n\n- Weekly online masterclasses led by professional engineers\n- Focus on emerging technologies such as machine learning and containerization\n- Applied practice with testing, deployment, and collaborative workflows\n\nLeague Labs operates like a studio: students apply, select a specialty team,\nand commit to weekly standups, sprint demos, and collaborative build sessions.\nMentors guide apprentices through research design, version control, testing,\nand technical writing so they graduate ready for internships, college labs, or\nopen-source contributions. League Labs projects often feed into our Code Clinic\nclasses and public workshops, giving students a platform to teach what they\nbuild.",
