    <p>This year we embarked upon a unique partnership with E3 Civic High School to offer Java programming classes as an elective class. It has been a great success and we hope the students have enjoyed it as much as we have! We are hoping that the students have gained a love for programming and will continue their programming education.</p>
    <p>The League is a 501c(3) non-profit institution and our mission is to provide programming instruction to underserved areas of San Diego. Our goal is to provide this instruction to as many students as possible!</p>
