    title: 'Sexual Harassment',
    body: `
<p>Sexual harassment is discrimination and is illegal under federal, state, and local laws. As defined by Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guidelines, sexual harassment includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Submission to the conduct is made explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of employment;</li>
  <li>Submission to or rejection of the conduct is used as the basis for employment decisions; or</li>
  <li>The conduct unreasonably interferes with work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment for staff or students.</li>
</ul>
<p>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 recognizes two categories of sexual harassment: quid pro quo and hostile work environment. Sexual harassment can involve subtle or overt behavior and may occur between individuals of any gender. Examples include unwanted advances, sexual jokes, comments about someone's body, leering, unwanted touching, or displaying sexually suggestive objects or images.</p>

<p>Harassment based on any protected characteristic is prohibited. Harassment includes verbal, written, or physical conduct that denigrates or shows hostility toward an individual because of a protected characteristic or that of their relatives, friends, or associates, and that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment;</li>
  <li>Unreasonably interferes with work performance; or</li>
  <li>Adversely affects employment opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples include epithets, slurs, negative stereotyping, threatening or hostile acts, denigrating jokes, and written or graphic material that shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group.</p>

<p>The LEAGUE encourages reporting of all perceived incidents, regardless of the offender's role. Individuals who believe they are experiencing prohibited conduct should contact their teacher, the operations team, the Executive Director, or a Board member.</p>
<p>Individuals are also encouraged to advise the offender directly that the behavior is unwelcome. If the situation persists or if direct communication is not possible, the formal complaint procedure is available.</p>

  {
    id: 'complaint-procedure',
    title: 'Complaint Procedure',
    body: `
<p>Those who believe they have experienced or witnessed prohibited conduct should discuss concerns with the Executive Director or a Board member. Prompt reporting allows for timely, constructive action.</p>
<p>Reported allegations will be investigated promptly. The process may include individual interviews with involved parties and witnesses. The LEAGUE maintains confidentiality during the investigation as much as possible while allowing a thorough review.</p>
<p>Retaliation against anyone reporting or participating in an investigation is prohibited and will result in disciplinary action. Responsive actions may include training, counseling, warnings, removal from classes, reassignment, suspension, or termination, depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p>If a party disagrees with the resolution, they may appeal to the Executive Director or the Board chair. False and malicious complaints, as opposed to good-faith concerns, may result in disciplinary action.</p>
