      <h2>Membership Plans and Passes</h2>
      <div class="policy-section__content">
        <p>
          Tuition plans cover one class per week and post on the first of each month. Monthly tuition stays the same regardless of how many weeks fall in the billing cycle or whether a student is absent. Holidays are built into the tuition rate, so separate make-up classes are not provided for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Membership plans provide six visits per month, and up to two unused visits roll into the following month. Families manage scheduling through the portal by enrolling in classes and cancelling as needed. No-shows will deduct a visit. There are no refunds for unused visits that exceed the rollover limit, so place a hold on the membership if you expect to miss several classes.

        <p>
          Tuition payments are processed through our auto-pay program. A valid credit card must be added to your Parent Portal account when you enroll so that charges can draft automatically each month.
        </p>
        <p class="policy-note">Set up auto-pay in the Client Portal:</p>

        <p>
          Consistent attendance helps students build momentum, but make-up visits are available when schedule conflicts happen. Cancel your original class in the portal and a make-up pass will appear on your account.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can apply the pass to another class in the same week or on a future date. Enroll in a session that matches your student's topic and level, then select the pass you would like to use at checkout. All make-ups are self-scheduled through the portal like any other class.

          Visit your <a href="https://jtl.pike13.com/me" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">LEAGUE profile</a> to review available make-up passes and schedule the next visit.

          If tuition is received after the first of the month, a $25 late fee is automatically added to the account. Families are responsible for making payments on time; extensions are not offered.
