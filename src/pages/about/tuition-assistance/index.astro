      <h1>Tuition Assistance</h1>
      <p>
        As a nonprofit, we believe every student deserves access to computer science education regardless of household income. We reserve tuition assistance spots for San Diego County students who qualify for financial support.
      </p>
      <p>
        Families with students participating in the Federal Free and Reduced Lunch Program may qualify for 100% financial aid on workshops and regular classes. Additional aid is available on a sliding scale based on household income.
      </p>
      <p class="tuition-hero__note">
        Tuition assistance must be renewed each year. Regular attendance is required; the League may reassign the spot if classes are missed consistently.
