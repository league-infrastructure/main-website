    <h2>Membership Plans and Passes</h2>
    <div class="policy-section__content">
      <p>
        Tuition plans cover one class per week and post on the first of each
        month. Monthly tuition stays the same regardless of how many weeks fall
        in the billing cycle or whether a student is absent. Holidays are built
        into the tuition rate, so separate make-up classes are not provided for
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Membership plans provide six visits per month, and up to two unused
        visits roll into the following month. Families manage scheduling through
        the portal by enrolling in classes and cancelling as needed. No-shows
        will deduct a visit. There are no refunds for unused visits that exceed
        the rollover limit, so place a hold on the membership if you expect to
        miss several classes.

    <div class="policy-section__content">
      <p>
        Tuition payments are processed through our auto-pay program. A valid
        credit card must be added to your Parent Portal account when you
        enroll so that charges can draft automatically each month.

      <p>
        Consistent attendance helps students build momentum, but make-up
        visits are available when schedule conflicts happen. Cancel your
        original class in the portal and a make-up pass will appear on your
        account.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can apply the pass to another class in the same week or on a
        future date. Enroll in a session that matches your student's topic and
        level, then select the pass you would like to use at checkout. All
        make-ups are self-scheduled through the portal like any other class.

        Tuition is non-refundable and non-transferable. Credits, rollovers, or
        adjustments are not issued for absences or closures.

      <p>
        If tuition is received after the first of the month, a $25 late fee is
        automatically added to the account. Families are responsible for
        making payments on time; extensions are not offered.
