        For students who benefit from individualized attention or need flexible
        scheduling, we offer private tutoring in both Java and Python. These 1:1 virtual
        sessions allow instructors to customize the pace and content to each student's
        specific needs, learning style, and goals. Whether a student needs help catching
        up, wants to advance more quickly, or requires accommodation for learning
        differences, private tutoring provides the most personalized learning
        experience. Tutoring is available for all levels from complete beginner to
        advanced, with monthly tuition of $430.
