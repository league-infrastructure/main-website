        Python OrbitLab introduces students to computational science through the
        fascinating topic of orbital mechanics. Students program simulations of planets,
        moons, and satellites, learning how gravity shapes the motion of celestial
        bodies. The course teaches numerical integration, vector mathematics, and
        physics simulation while developing a deep understanding of how our solar system
        works. Students create visualizations of their simulations and explore what-if
        scenarios, like adding extra planets or changing gravitational constants. This
        course demonstrates how programming is used in real scientific research and
        space exploration, connecting coding skills to STEM education in a highly
        engaging way.
