        The Soldering Clinic teaches students essential soldering skills through
        practical, hands-on experience. Students learn safety procedures and proper
        soldering techniques that enable them to construct soldering kits. As part of
        the class, students receive a small soldering kit to practice with, and are
        encouraged to bring their own kits from home to continue developing their
        skills. This clinic supports our robotics program by giving students the ability
        to assemble and modify electronic components, but the skills learned apply to
        any electronics project. This clinic may be offered as part of the robotics
        program or as a standalone workshop.
