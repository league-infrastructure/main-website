        This specialized course extends Python game development by teaching students how
        to port their Python games to run directly in web browsers. Students learn web
        technologies and how Python can be used in web contexts, making their games
        instantly shareable with anyone who has an internet connection. This course
        bridges the gap between traditional programming and modern web development,
        teaching valuable skills about cross-platform deployment and web technologies
        while keeping the focus on fun, engaging game projects.
