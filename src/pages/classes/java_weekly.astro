        Our Java program offers a complete pathway from introduction through advanced
        programming, with curriculum aligned to AP Computer Science standards. Java is
        the dominant language in corporate computing, particularly in finance, and
        powers cutting-edge technologies including cloud computing, NASA space
        exploration, and self-driving cars. Students learn fundamental programming
        concepts, object-oriented design, data structures, and algorithms through
        hands-on projects. Our experienced instructors guide students toward
        professional Java certification, which opens doors to job opportunities at
        companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Sony. Classes meet weekly for 1.5
        hours with a 5:1 student-to-teacher ratio, available both in-person and online.
