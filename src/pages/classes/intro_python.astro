        This foundational course introduces students in grades 4-12 to the Python
        programming language for the first time. Students learn basic programming
        concepts through engaging, hands-on projects that make coding fun and
        accessible. This course serves as the gateway to our comprehensive Python
        curriculum and prepares students for more advanced study. Classes meet once per
        week for 1.5 hours with a 5:1 student-to-teacher ratio.
