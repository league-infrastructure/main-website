        The Motors Clinic is a focused two-hour workshop teaching students how to
        control different types of motors through programming. Students learn the
        electrical and software principles behind motor control, including PWM
        (pulse-width modulation) for controlling motor speed and direction. The class
        covers brush DC motors, stepper motors for precise positioning, and hobby servo
        motors commonly used in robotics. While often taken as part of the robotics
        program, the Motors Clinic can also be taken standalone by students interested
        in electronics and automation. This hands-on class gives students practical
        skills for any project involving mechanical motion.
