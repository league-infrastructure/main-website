        In this web development course, students create their own professional portfolio
        website to showcase their programming projects and accomplishments. Using GitHub
        Pages and the Jekyll static site generator, students learn HTML, CSS, and modern
        web development workflows including version control with Git. The resulting
        portfolio site serves as both a learning project and a practical tool for
        college applications and future job searches. Students learn how professional
        developers deploy websites, manage code versions, and create responsive designs
        that work on all devices. Every student leaves with a live website they can
        continue to update throughout their programming journey.
