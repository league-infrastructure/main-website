        Microbit Robot Rally combines programming, robotics, and game design in an
        exciting competitive format. Students learn the basics of controlling motors on
        a robot, starting with existing robot platforms that they modify to make more
        competitive. Students add grippers, pushers, flippers, and other attachments to
        their robots, then learn how to reprogram them to activate electronics like
        turbos and lights. The course teaches how to send messages back and forth
        between the joystick controller and the robot, giving students hands-on
        experience with how robots respond to commands. This course is currently in
        development and represents an innovative approach to teaching robotics through
        competitive gameplay.
