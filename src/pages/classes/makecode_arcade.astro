        MakeCode Arcade Games offers an exciting entry point into game development using
        Microsoft's visual programming platform. Students can program using
        drag-and-drop blocks, JavaScript, or a combination of both, making it accessible
        to beginners while offering depth for more advanced students. The real magic
        happens when students deploy their games to physical handheld consoles that they
        can play anytime, anywhere. This course teaches game design principles,
        programming logic, sprite animation, and collision detection while producing
        tangible, playable results. It's perfect for students who love gaming and want
        to understand how their favorite games work.
