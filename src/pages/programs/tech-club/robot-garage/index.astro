        <p>
          The Robot Garage is where League students design, wire, and program robots from the ground up. Teams work with
          motors, cameras, microcontrollers, and sensors to ship ambitious hardware projects while receiving mentorship
          from industry professionals.

          Projects range from autonomous rovers and robotic arms to face-tracking cameras. Students document their work in
          GitHub and practice iterative design so they can present polished demos to robotics teams, college admissions
          offices, and potential employers.

            Students sharpen their Python and Java skills, practice FIRST tooling, and experiment with advanced concepts
            such as PID control, filtering, AprilTags, and autonomous route planning. We are recruiting robotics students,
            volunteer instructors, and adult sponsors to help shape the curriculum.
          </p>
          <p>
            The FIRST Robotics program connects three pathways based on how you want to participate:
          </p>
          <ul>
            {clinicLists.map((item) => (
              <li>{item}</li>
            ))}
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you are already on a FIRST team, complete the registration form so we can coordinate classes, mentors, and
            space for your season.
