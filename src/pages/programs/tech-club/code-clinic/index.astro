        <p>
          Code Clinic is a free program for students who want to go beyond AP Computer Science. Each session is a one-hour
          dive into professional topics such as neural networks, data analysis, containerization, or refactoring. Students
          leave with new tools, repos to explore, and a path toward self-directed projects.

          Sessions are hosted live on Zoom with occasional in-person meetups for hands-on hardware labs. Instructors walk
          through real repositories, tooling, and production workflows so students gain experience with the same practices
          used by professional engineers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many attendees are preparing for internships, leading FIRST robotics teams, or expanding their portfolios for
          college applications. Alumni frequently mentor new participants, keeping the clinic collaborative and fast paced.
