<h1>New Classes For Fall</h1>
We've been polling students, staff and parents about what new classes we should introduce for fall, and we're whittling it down to a short list.

If you like to vote on these options, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeI2hw4ZooO5se_OaR7_TVnVVQmY5vpUzZHtjps6tfACdmX7A/viewform?usp=sf_link">the survey form is still open, so let us know what you are intersted in. </a>

Here are the current leading contenders, with more description about the content and structure of the classes.
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine Learning and AI</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Students will begin with a review of Python and an introduction to data analysis in Python using Pandas, Numpy, Jupyter and Colab. We will start with learning how to program applications using ChatGPT, HuggingFace and other pre-trained models, then move on to learning how to build the models. Higher levels will cover topics in  statistics, regression, machine learning, decision trees, classification and similar topics.  Online. </span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robotics</span></h2>
