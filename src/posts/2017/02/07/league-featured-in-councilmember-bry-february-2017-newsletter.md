<span style="color: #999999;">February 2017</span>

"It was inspiring to learn about the projects young coding students are working on at the League of Amazing Programmers. I was especially impressed by a high school student who developed an app that tracks crime data geographically. These bright young minds are the future of our innovation economy."
