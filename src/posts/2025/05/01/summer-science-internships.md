The<a href="https://www.gsdsef.org/"> Greater San Diego Science and Engineering Fair</a> and the<a href="https://www.jointheleague.org/"> LEAGUE of Amazing Programmers</a> are working together to offer a special version of the LEAGUE's summer internship program, League Labs. Interns will work with professional programmers to develop short classes teaching other students a topic at the intersection of science and computing. Show other student how you built a machine vision algorithm, or how to use an Arduino to measure soil pH, or how to test a hypothesis using Python or R; you can pick almost any topic to turn into a class, as long as there is some software involved.

The League Labs program starts 1 June, with informational meetings in May.
