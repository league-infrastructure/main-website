**Home Page Contrast**
- Legacy hero background runs from white at the top into a peach band (#FCDAC5) at the fold; the Astro rebuild overlays a cool indigo wash (#5D5FEF at ~18% opacity) before blending into the same peach, so the new header reads distinctly blue-to-peach.
- Legacy navigation carries an orange script tagline and stacked phone/location strip; the new header keeps only monochrome contact links and a simplified logo lockup.
- Original call-to-action buttons lean on bright orange and teal; new CTAs use the Fulldev palette (primary indigo, secondary outline) for greater contrast against the light background.
- Footer color blocks (newsletter orange band, dark gray legal bar) disappear; the refreshed footer is a single white panel with muted text links.

**Content Shifts**
- Old hero leads with an H3 plus collage imagery and no immediate CTA; new hero adds a subheading label, concise value statement, and two prominent buttons (“View Our Programs”, “Join Now”).
- [DONE] Legacy page dedicates individual cards to Python, Java, Tech Club, and Code Clinic with direct in-person/online enrollment links; the demo collapses those into a single “Weekly Programming Classes” narrative without plan-specific buttons.
- [DONE] Legacy “Other Programs” grid (League Labs, Project Clinic, Programming Merit Badge) is missing; the demo home lacks links or visuals for those offerings beyond the testimonials gallery.
- [DONE] Tuition Assistance panel (copy, Typeform link, policy note) is absent; financial aid now only appears indirectly via footer Explore → Policies.
- [DONE] “Preparing Youth for Careers” logos remain but move higher in the layout; the legacy copy emphasizes internship outcomes, while the demo variant shortens supporting text.
- [DONE] Legacy footer retains newsletter signup, nonprofit badges, and Scout photography; the demo footer drops signup fields and badges in favor of condensed contact and policy links.
