**Vision:**
We envision a future where the tech landscape is characterized by inclusivity and fairness, where students from all backgrounds see themselves as capable creators of technology, not just consumers.

**Our Approach:**
We make coding education accessible through free community-based programs, comprehensive curriculum from beginner to advanced levels, and partnerships with schools and libraries across San Diego County. We meet students where they are - in their schools, neighborhoods, and communities.

**Core Values:**
- **Accessible**: Removing barriers to quality STEM education
- **Excellent**: Maintaining high standards in curriculum and instruction
- **Inclusive**: Actively welcoming students of all backgrounds
- **Innovative**: Continuously evolving our programs and methods

## Major Achievement: Curriculum Transformation

One of the most significant developments this year was the complete rebuild and expansion of our curriculum. We evolved from a single-track Java program to a comprehensive, multi-pathway technical education program that reflects the breadth of modern technology careers.

### The Shift: From Programming-Only to Integrated Technical Education

Previously, our curriculum focused primarily on Java programming. While this served students well, we recognized that modern technology education requires a broader foundation. Students need exposure to programming, physical computing, making, and design.

**What We Built:**

### New Integrated Programs

**Robot Rally: A Complete Technical Education Project**
Robot Rally represents our vision of integrated technical education. Students don't just program - they design, fabricate, assemble, and troubleshoot complete robotic systems.

Components:
- **Programming**: Python and microcontroller programming for robot control
- **3D Printing**: Designing and fabricating custom robot parts
- **CAD**: Computer-aided design for mechanical components
- **Electronics**: Understanding circuits, sensors, and motor control
- **Mechanical Assembly**: Building and testing physical robots

**Tech Arcade: Integrated Learning Spaces**
Tech Arcade classes combine programming, game development, robotics, and electronics in exploratory, project-based sessions.

### Expanded Core Curriculum

**Python Education:**
- Python Apprentice (comprehensive beginner curriculum)
- Python Games (game development for all levels)
- Python for Data Analysis (computational science introduction)

**Microcontroller Programming:**
- Micro:bit fundamentals (Block, Python, JavaScript)
- Robot control systems (motors, sensors, communication)
- Mobile robotics (autonomous navigation)

**Maker Skills:**
- Soldering and electronics (circuit building)
- 3D printing (design and fabrication)
- CAD (computer-aided design fundamentals)

**Traditional Programming:**
- Java programming (beginner through advanced, AP CS prep)
- JavaScript (web-based programming)

**All curriculum is openly available at curriculum.jointheleague.org**

### Why This Matters

This curriculum transformation positions students for success in multiple technology career paths - not just software development, but also robotics engineering, hardware design, manufacturing, and interdisciplinary technology fields. Students discover that technology is about creating physical solutions to real problems, not just writing code.

The integrated approach also makes technology education more accessible and appealing to students who might not initially see themselves as "programmers." A student interested in art can enter through 3D design. A student who likes building things can start with robots. A student fascinated by games can begin with Python Games. All pathways lead to solid technical foundations.

## Diversity and Inclusion: Making STEM Accessible

### Female Participation: 40.7%

One of our most significant achievements is maintaining 40.7% female participation across all Tech Club programs. This far exceeds typical computer science education demographics, where women represent only about 20% of undergraduate CS majors nationally.

**503 girls** participated in our Tech Club programs in 2024-2025, out of 1,236 total student attendances.

### Our Approach to Inclusivity

**Free Programming**
By offering Tech Club at no cost, we remove financial barriers that disproportionately affect underrepresented groups in technology.

**Community-Based Delivery**
Meeting students where they are - in their schools, libraries, and neighborhoods - increases access for students who lack transportation or live in underserved areas.

**Diverse Curriculum**
Multiple entry points (Python, Java, robotics, games, electronics) appeal to varied interests, helping more students find their connection to technology.

**Welcoming Environment**
Focus on practical, hands-on projects in a supportive learning environment where questions are encouraged and mistakes are learning opportunities.

**Varied Role Models**
Student volunteers, diverse staff, and community partnerships show students that technology is for everyone.

### Communities Served

**Geographic Diversity**
Programs across San Diego County, from coastal communities to inland areas, reaching urban, suburban, and underserved neighborhoods.

**Economic Diversity**
Students from economically diverse backgrounds, with free programming ensuring access regardless of family financial status.

**Educational Settings**
Public schools, private schools, charter schools, homeschool students, and community-based learners.

**Grade Levels**
Students in grades 4-12, with curriculum appropriate for each developmental stage.

## Strategic Direction: Positioned for Growth

### What We've Accomplished

Over the past year, we've built the foundation for significant expansion:

**Proven Model**
Tech Club has demonstrated success across diverse settings - libraries, schools, community centers. With 117 events reaching 1,236 students while maintaining 40.7% female participation, we've shown that this model works and scales.

**Comprehensive Curriculum**
Our curriculum transformation from single-track programming to integrated technical education makes us more relevant and appealing to today's students. The openly available curriculum at curriculum.jointheleague.org enables other organizations to benefit from our work.

**Strong Partnerships**
Relationships with 15 schools, 10 libraries, and multiple community organizations provide a foundation for expansion.

**Refined Operations**
After a year of successful program delivery across 30+ sites, we understand what it takes to launch and sustain Tech Club programs in new locations.

### What's Next

**Expanding Tech Club Reach**
With the model proven, we're ready to bring Tech Club to additional schools and community sites. Each new location allows us to reach 100-200 more students annually.

**Developing Advanced Pathways**
Building on successful introductory programs, we're developing advanced tracks for students ready to go deeper - including AP Computer Science preparation, advanced robotics, and specialized technical skills.

**Strengthening Partnerships**
Deepening relationships with existing partners and developing new collaborations with school districts, community organizations, and tech companies.

**Documenting Impact**
Implementing systems to track student learning outcomes, skill development, and long-term educational paths to better demonstrate our impact.

### Vision for 2025-2026

We envision reaching 2,000+ student attendances through expanded Tech Club programming, launching in 10-15 new sites, and continuing to maintain our commitment to gender diversity and accessibility. We'll continue refining our integrated technical education model, demonstrating that coding education is most powerful when combined with hands-on making, design, and problem-solving.
